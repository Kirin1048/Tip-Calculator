# Tip-Calculator
Thia repo takes some user inputs for the amount of people in the group, the amount of the bill, and the amout of tip the group is planning on paying. It assumes that the group has decided to split the bill evenly and everyone has agreed to the same amount for the tip.     

This repo shows that I understand ho to assign user input into variables and how I can change variable data types so that the output makes more sense, returning $10.00 instead of $10.0.
